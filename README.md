## Project Background
Bowtie, a Hong Kong insurance company started in 2018, sells insurance online. It uses famous people to give money tips on their official YouTube channel to make its brand known. This works well but costs a lot. As a data analyst on the marketing team, I am curious whether we could try using small YouTube channels run by insurance agents to save money and still grow the brand.

  ## Ideas
  Findings  suggest  that  while  micro-influencers may not surpass celebrities in reach, they often excel in building authentic connections with audiences, thereby enhancing brand trust and consumer loyalty.

  Their  recommendations  are  perceived  as more  genuine  and  trustworthy,  leading  to  higher  engagement  rates  and  more favorable brand sentiments.
