## Project Background
Bowtie, a Hong Kong insurance company started in 2018, sells insurance online. It uses famous people to give money tips on their official YouTube channel to make its brand known. This works well but costs a lot. As a data analyst on the marketing team, I am curious whether we could try using small YouTube channels run by insurance agents to save money and still grow the brand.
